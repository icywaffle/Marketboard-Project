## Marketboard Project
Designed to calculate the most profitable crafted item from a popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV.

## Motivation
This is similar to ffxivmb.com, where they grab user obtained data, and find organize the data to show items that have the greatest profit.
However, it's difficult to navigate through ffxivmb, and you have to individually go through the items to show how much profit it gives when creating the item.
This project is meant to allow you to easily see whether or not an item will make you a profit by crafting it, rather than a deficit if you could just sell the mats for more gil.
This project can add more additional features such as easier crafting and gathering, but this is way in the future.
